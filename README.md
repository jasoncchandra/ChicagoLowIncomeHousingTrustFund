# Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund

I am a data scientist volunteer for the Chicago low income housing trust fund!

**Some accomplishments I've done:**

•Leveraged Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) to achieve a 95% data completeness rate by cleaning the dataset related to new Chicago housing units, eliminating 20% of erroneous entries

•Applied geospatial analysis to merge cleaned data with GeoJSON files for precise geographic visualizations and produced 4 PDF project reports summarizing key insights on Chicago's new housing units, contributing to data-driven decisions


**Some things I want to do in the future:**

***Predictive Analytics for Housing Demand:***
Develop a predictive model to estimate the future demand for low-income housing in different Chicago neighborhoods. You can use historical data on population trends, economic indicators, and housing availability to build this model.

***Optimizing Allocation of Funds:***
Create an algorithm that optimizes the allocation of funds for housing projects based on factors like demand, cost, and impact. This can help ensure that resources are directed to areas with the greatest need.

***Housing Quality Assessment:***
Build a computer vision model to assess the quality of low-income housing units. This can involve image analysis to identify maintenance issues and prioritize repair or renovation efforts.
